All scripts that are placed in a folder called Editor (or a sub-folder within it) will be treated as editor scripts rather than runtime scripts. Such scripts are designed to add functionality to Unity itself during development and are not available to the finished game at runtime. More than one Editor folder can be used in the project at once but note that the exact location of a given Editor folder affects the time at which its scripts will be compiled relative to other scripts. See the page on Special Folders and Script Compilation Order for a full description of this. Note: Unity will not allow components derived from MonoBehaviour to be assigned to GameObjects if the scripts are in the Editor folder.
