Unity lets you add Plugins to a project to extend the features available to Unity. Plugins are native DLLs that are typically written in C/C++. They can access third party code libraries, system calls and other things that are not provided by Unity out of the box. Plugins must be placed in a folder called Plugins to be detected by Unity and like the Editor folder, this affects the order in which scripts are compiled. See the page on Special Folders and Script Compilation Order for further details.
