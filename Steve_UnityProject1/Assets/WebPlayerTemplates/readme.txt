For webplayer builds, Unity lets you supply a custom host page to deliver the player. The host page is supplied in the form of a template that can incorporate specific information from the project such as its name. These templates must be placed in a folder called WebPlayerTemplates to be available to Unity; see the page about Using Web Player templates for further details. It is also worth noting that any scripts placed in the WebPlayerTemplates folder will be ignored by the compiler. Placing script files here can be a useful temporary way to stop them from being compiled, say if they contain incomplete code that will prevent the game running.
